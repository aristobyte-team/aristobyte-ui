- create a script which identifies the order of the tsconfig.build.json
- create up to date create-package scripts (identify which packages are non-usual such as cli or eslint-config)
- update eslint-confg, typescript-config, jest-config and create prettier-config
- fix the cli types and build it in a proper way with new tsconfigs
- create sandbox in apps just for the component implementation and point directly to the local packages instead of remote
- fully fix the apps/docs and decide create proper tsconfig to look for the packages from remote
- fix the react package which should export all the packages
