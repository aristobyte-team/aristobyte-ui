- fix packages such as eslint-config etc... (proper build or proper export in package.json) - if needed then use manual build instead of tsc
- fix the deps in apps/docs so it's aligned with the global yarn, decide or ask GPT if it should be added to global package.json with -W or into @aristobyte-ui/docs using workspace add
- remove of all tailwindcss stuff and use only .scss + from docs
